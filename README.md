# Prism: Unlocking Language Model Capability Extraction

Authors: Abhishek Mishra, Krishna Pagare

A trained language model holds many capabilities at once, while a deployment
usually asks it to exercise only one. Prism asks whether a named capability can
be made to run through a sparse set of MLP channels while the surrounding
transformer scaffold stays fixed and the rest of the MLP is switched off.

This repository is the public code and artifact index for the paper. It is not
a compressed model release. It is an intervention package: experiment scripts,
small result receipts, the paper PDF, figure assets, and pinned public artifacts
that let a reader inspect how each reported substrate was selected,
conditioned, and scored.

## The extraction contract

Attribution is not enough. A channel can correlate with a behavior without
being sufficient to run it. Prism tests sufficiency by keeping a candidate mask,
disabling the complement, and measuring how much of the original behavior
survives under that intervention.

```mermaid

    A["target behavior"] --> B["score MLP channels"]
    B --> C["keep top-k mask"]
    C --> D["disable complement"]
    D --> E["measure recovery"]
    F["collimation adapter"] --> B
    F --> C
```

Collimation is the behavior-preserving step that changes where a capability is
carried internally. The key distinction is timing. If collimation runs before
attribution, it can move the sparsity frontier because the mask is found after
the representation changes. If it runs after attribution, the mask is already
fixed, so the adapter can only route more behavior through the surviving
channels.

| regime | order | what it can change | where it appears |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pre-attribution collimation | collimate -> attribute -> mask | which channels carry the capability | arithmetic |
| Post-attribution collimation | attribute -> mask -> collimate | how much behavior fits through fixed channels | translation, function calling |

## Main release results

| capability | model | intervention claim | released evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Two-digit addition | `Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B` | Pre-attribution collimation moves recovery from 29.00% to 91.33% while keeping about 5% of MLP channels. | arithmetic masks, training summaries, and evaluation receipts |
| EN-PT translation | `HY-MT1.5-1.8B` | Rescue at the same substrate recovers strongly, while replacement fails under the same region. | NTREX builder, rescue summaries, adapters, and mask receipts |
| Function calling | `Qwen3-8B` | Post-attribution collimation raises recovery from 19.1% to 84.6% at the fixed k160 substrate. | BFCL filters, scoring scripts, adapters, and evaluation receipts |

The paper PDF and figure assets are in `paper/`. The claim-to-artifact index is
`docs/ARTIFACT_MANIFEST.json`.

## Repository map

| path | role |
|---|---|
| `code/` | runnable scripts for arithmetic, translation, and BFCL/function-calling experiments |
| `code/src/circuit_tracing/` | shared arithmetic circuit-tracing utilities |
| `code/scripts/` | BFCL filtering, scoring, conditioning, and evaluation scripts |
| `code/configs/` | sanitized configs for released runs |
| `results/` | small result receipts included in git |
| `docs/` | release boundary, data-source notes, terminology, and artifact manifest |
| `paper/` | paper PDF and figure/image assets |

Large model checkpoints, generated datasets, raw attribution arrays, adapters,
and full-model outputs are hosted on Hugging Face rather than committed to git.

## Install

Use Python 3.12+.

```bash
uv venv --python 3.12 .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e ./code
```

The standard-library venv path also works.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e ./code
```

Most experiment reruns require GPU hardware and public model downloads. The
default circuit-tracing tests use `Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B` and CUDA when available.

```bash
cd code
python -m pytest src/circuit_tracing/test_pipeline.py -v
```

Slow edge-attribution and end-to-end tests are opt-in.

```bash
PRISM_RUN_SLOW_TESTS=1 python -m pytest src/circuit_tracing/test_pipeline.py -v
```

## Reproduce

Start with `REPRODUCE.md` for task-level commands. The short version is:

| task family | entry point |
|---|---|
| Arithmetic extraction | `code/src/circuit_tracing/`, `code/train_lora_2digit_kl.py`, and arithmetic evaluation scripts |
| Translation rescue | `code/build_ntrex_en2pt_jsonl.py`, `code/train_masked_kl_conditioning.py`, and translation evaluation scripts |
| Function calling | `code/scripts/bfcl_direct_qwen3.py` and BFCL masked-LoRA training scripts |

The repository keeps small receipts in `results/`. Complete artifacts are
pinned by immutable revision SHA in the manifest.
